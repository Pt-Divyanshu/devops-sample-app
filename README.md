# 🚀 DevOps Sample App – Internship Task

This repository is part of my internship project where I learned and implemented a basic DevOps workflow using Git, GitHub,Git Bash,Python

---

## 🎯 Internship Objective

To simulate a professional development workflow by:

- Initializing a local Git repository
- Creating and managing branches (`main`, `dev`, `feature/add-app`)
- Writing and committing code
- Pushing to GitHub using a personal access token (PAT)
- Creating pull requests and merging branches
- Following Git best practices
  ------

## 📁 Project Structure

devops-sample-app/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── src/
└── app.py
----

---

## 🛠️ Technology Used

- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and remote repo management
- **Python** – For writing a simple test script
- **Git Bash** – For running all Git commands

---

## 🧪 App Overview

This app is a simple Python script that prints a message when executed.

```python
def main():
    print("Hello from DevOps Sample App!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
--------
Steps I Completed
✅ Created a GitHub repo (without README/.gitignore)

✅ Initialized a local Git repo and connected to GitHub

✅ Created main, dev, and feature/add-app branches

✅ Wrote app.py and committed changes

✅ Pushed all branches to GitHub

✅ Created and merged pull requests (dev → main, then feature/add-app → main)

✅ Verified the final output on the main branch
